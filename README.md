It's a fun wesbite where your goal is to get to the next page, then the next, then the next, and so on. Some of the pages are puzzles that you need to figure out, some other are
games. Here is a list of all the pages and what to do(spoiler aler!):

- Page 1: It looks like a 404 page but there is a little text on the side that links you to the next page
- Page 2: There is a smiling face emoji that follows you around using it's eyes, you have to click it's eyes to disturb him and go to the next page
- Page 3: There is text on the top left that says: "Your a fart smella" that links you back to page 1. And secret text that blends with the background on the top right that says: "your a smart fella" that links you to the next page
- Page 4: There is a massive "Click Me" button that doesn't do anything, the trick is to drag it out, revealing a button that actually takes you to the next page
- Page 5: "Click cookie" is the task, there are a bunch of cookies including a text that says cookie but none of them do anything, you have to click the word cookie in the task name
- Page 6: Align the shadows, this one is pretty straight forward, just align the shadows of the text and a button will appear leading you to the next page
- Page 7: A rock paper scissors game where you have to beat the CPU to move on
- Page 8: A snake game where you have to get 8 points to reveal a button that leads you to the next page.
- Page 9: A hangman game where you have to guess the word to lead you to the FINAL PAGE
- Page 10(FINAL PAGE: A little page with a cookie for you!
